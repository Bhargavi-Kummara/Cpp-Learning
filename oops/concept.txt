There are four most important concepts of object oriented programming
They are: 1. Encapsulation
          2. Abstraction
          3. Inheritance
          4. Polymorphism

1. Encapsulation: Idea of bundling data together with methods in a class. We do this to prevent
                  anyone or anything outside of our class to be able to 'directly' access our data
                  and to interact it or to modify it.

2. Abstraction: Abstraction is hiding complex things behind a procedure that makes those things look 
                simple. Example: Taking pictures in smart phone is simple that we just press a button,
                but that is not just simple because for us it's just a button click, but for a company
                that makes smart phones there is a much more complex logic that they need to implement 
                inorder for us to be able to press a button and take a picture. This process of hiding
                that complexity from user is called Abstraction.

3. Inheritance: The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is
                called Inheritance. In simple words, it allows us to create a new derived class from an 
                existing base class. The derived class inherits the features from the base class and can
                also have additional features on its own.

4. Polymorphism: Coming from greek words 'poly' and 'morph' which means 'many forms'. In programming 
                 Polymorphism describes the ability of an object or a method to have many forms. Most 
                 common use of Polymorphism in programming is when a parent class reference is used to 
                 refer to a object of child class.
